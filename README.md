# Pinterest Downloader v2
This project is a continuation on [Juraji/Pinterest-Downloader](https://github.com/Juraji/Pinterest-Downloader).

Since Pinterest changes their application token policy we had to come up with something else.
This version uses a database for storing pin metadata and hashes for comparison, so no more 30+ minute wait to have it scan for duplicates :D
